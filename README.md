### Server Side Logic Assignment

#### Assignment
This was the first assignment after learning Node.js/Express servers.
The goal was to create a calculator and run all logic on the server side.

#### Running App
You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed to run.
Clone or download the project zip. In the terminal navigate to the root project folder and enter `npm install` 
on the command line. This will download all dependencies. To run just enter `npm start` in the command line
and in a browser go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
